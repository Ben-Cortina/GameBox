# A level file should be a plain text file ending in .bdl

# First we define the floor and wall tile for the level as such
# <Letter> <Red 0-255> <Green 0-255> <Blue 0-255>
# Where letter is what you will use to describe the tile later

# Floor
O 255 255 255

# Wall
W 0 0 0

# Next we will define the level using the tiles defined above
# S will represent the start (there can only be one)
# E will represent the location that must be reached (there can be multiple)
# Spaces will be empty tiles
# If the end of a line is left blank, empty space is assumed

# Level
Name: Level 1
   WWWWWWWWW   
WWWWOOOWOOOWWWW 
WSOOOWOOOWOOOEW 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWW 

# Lastly, we will define the explosion timers 
# coordinates X Y (1 1 is bottom left) open bracket
# 5 2 would be where X is
#    WWWWWWWWW   
# WWWWOOOWOOOWWWW 
# WSOOXWOOOWOOOEW 
# WWWWWWWWWWWWWWW 

# Multiple coordinates can be designated definition
#so the following will define all the tiles marked as X
#    WWWWWWWWW   
# WWWWOXOWOXOWWWW 
# WSOOXWXOXWXOOEW 
# WWWWWWWWWWWWWWW 

# coords 
5 2

# begin
{

# first explosion time 
0.0

# time between explosions 
1.0

# kill duration
0.0

# color of explosion
255 100 100

# end
}

# This means there will be a explosion orangered explosion
# at each of those coords that will go off immediately and will only kill 
# players currently on it (if the explosion duration was non-zero
# it would kill anyone crossing into it during the duration.
# Then, 1 second after it has ended it 
# will go off again.

# Multiple explosions can be placed on the same tile.
