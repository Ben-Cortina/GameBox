NOTE: In addition to me wanting to learn Unity, Unity3D has recently improved support for 2D games. Thus, after I finish the Bound game I will begin porting this to Unity3D.

This is a series of simple games I will be making as I learn cocos2dx. 

Feel free to use my work to learn with me, Ill try to keep it commented to explain what
each of the important cocos2dx classes and functions do!

The Xcode project should always work. Currently, keyboard input is not supported for the
windows side of cocos2d-x so until the cocos team or I get around to fixing that there
I won't be updating the Visual Studio solution. 

If you like to use some snippets of my code in your work, that's alright but I ask that you give me credit for my work, just mention it was borrowed from "Ben Cortina"
