This is a series of simple games I will be making as I learn cocos2dx. 

Feel free to use my work to learn with me, Ill try to keep it commented to explain what
each of the important cocos2dx classes and functions do!

The Xcode project should always work. I will also update the VS12 solution periodically. 

If you like to use some snippets of my code in your work, that's alright but I ask that you give me credit for my work, just mention it was borrowed from "Ben Cortina"
